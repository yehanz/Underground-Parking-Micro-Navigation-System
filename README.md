# Underground-Parking-Micro-Navigation-System
Demonstration on my personal work in this project supplemented with an overview of the whole project.

## Brief Overview on the whole project
The project can be broken down into 3 functional module from the perspect of a user:

### Outdoor Navigation module
A relatively minor module responsible for outdoor navigation and parking place distribution display

### Indoor Car-parking-and-finding service module 
We set up a website attached to a Wechat public account via which a user can see the digital map of underground parking places with his or her real-time position marked on it. The page also provide the service of routine optimization. These 3 functionalities----map rendering, real-time positioning and routine optimization----combined to complete a car-parking-and-finding business. 

### Parking fee online inquery and settlement
A user can check the parking fee and make a payment online through another website.
